# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Funmilayo Balogun

I am a Business Data Analyst with hands-on experience across the Telecommunications and IT industry. I help organisations harness the power of data to optimise operations, improve customer experience, and make smarter business decisions.

In todayâ€™s data-driven landscape, companies that fail to transform raw data into actionable insights risk inefficiency, higher costs, and lost opportunities.
My expertise bridges this gap, turning complex datasets into clear stories and solutions that directly support business growth.
